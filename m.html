        <p><b>Aditya-L1 </b>(/aːd̪it̪jə/)[a] (from Sanskrit: Aditya, "Sun" and L1, "Lagrange point 1") is a <i>coronagraphy spacecraft</i> for studying the solar atmosphere, designed and developed by the <mark>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) </mark>and various other Indian research institutes.[1] It is orbiting at about <u>1.5 million km from Earth </u>in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) between the <em>Earth and the Sun</em>, where it will study the solar atmosphere, solar magnetic storms, and their impact on the environment around the Earth.[8]</p>

        <h>Mission objectives</h>
        <p>The <b>main objectives of Aditya-L1 </b>are:<br>

            To observe the dynamics of the Sun's <i>chromosphere and corona</i>:<br>
            To study chromospheric and coronal heating, the physics of partially ionised plasma, of <mark>coronal mass ejections (CMEs) </mark>and their origins, of the coronal magnetic field and heat transfer mechanisms, and flare exchanges.<br>
            To observe the <u>physical particle environment</u> around its position.<br>
            To determine the sequence of processes in multiple layers below the corona that lead to solar eruptions.<br>
            To study space weather, and the origin, and dynamics of solar wind.[16]</p>
